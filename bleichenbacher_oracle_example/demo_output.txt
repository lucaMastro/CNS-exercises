Dummy example of Bleichenbacher's Oracle

**************************************************

Generating p and q primes.
Let's start compute them betwen 1-st and 100-th
Primes:
p = 131
q = 3
N = p * q = 393

**************************************************

Need to find a public and private key pair: just computing it...

Phi value 260
Public key found: 3
Need to invert it...
Computing:	phi * a + public_key * b = 1
Found (a, b): (-1, 87)
Private_key found: 87

**************************************************

Let's try encryption and decryption.
I will crypt a random value betwen 2 and 100:	60
Encrypted with public_key: 243
Decrypted with private_key: 60

Starting (semplified) Bleichenbacher's Oracle Attack
The attacker knows:
	Public_key: 3
	Modulus N: 393
	Cipher text: 243

The number of possible values is: 393

Iteration_numer 1:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^1)^public_key
The message CT' is: 372, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 256 possibile values


Iteration_numer 2:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^2)^public_key
The message CT' is: 225, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 187 possibile values


Iteration_numer 3:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^3)^public_key
The message CT' is: 228, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 152 possibile values


Iteration_numer 4:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^4)^public_key
The message CT' is: 252, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 117 possibile values


Iteration_numer 5:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^5)^public_key
The message CT' is: 51, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 1
Reducing possible values...
There still are 26 possibile values


Iteration_numer 6:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^6)^public_key
The message CT' is: 15, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 1
Reducing possible values...
There still are 13 possibile values


Iteration_numer 7:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^7)^public_key
The message CT' is: 120, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 6 possibile values


Iteration_numer 8:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^8)^public_key
The message CT' is: 174, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 3 possibile values


Iteration_numer 9:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^9)^public_key
The message CT' is: 213, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 3 possibile values


Iteration_numer 10:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^10)^public_key
The message CT' is: 132, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 0
Reducing possible values...
There still are 2 possibile values


Iteration_numer 11:
Sending to oracle CT' = CT * (2^11)^public_key
The message CT' is: 270, 
Querying the oracle to know the first bit of PT'
First bit of PT' is 1
Reducing possible values...
There still are 1 possibile values


The attack gives the output: 60
