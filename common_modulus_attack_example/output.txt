Dummy example of RSA Common Modulus Attack
Generating 2 RSA key pair...
p = 13, q = 19
RSA keys generated.
            First pair:
            	Public_key: (e, N) = (5, 247)
            	Private_key: d = 173
            Second pair:
            	Public_key: (e, N) = (7, 247)
            	Private_key: d = 31
            
Trying attack on PT: 98

Starting Common Modulus Attack
______________________________

The attacker knows:
    public_key1: (e1, N) = (5, 247) 
    CT1 = 167

    public_key1: (e2, N) = (7, 247) 
    CT2 = 97
    
The attack can be done only if e1 and e2 are coprime.
Let's check it.
e1 and e2 are coprimes!! The attack can be done

Looking for s ad r such that:
    s * e1 + r * e2 = 1
    
s and r found: (s, r) = (3, -2)

What to do now is:
    (CT1)^r = [(PT)^e1]^r = (PT)^(e1*r)
    (CT2)^s = [(PT)^e2]^s = (PT)^(e2*s)
and then multiplay them.

The result is: 98
